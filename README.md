# Generalized-Linear-Models
The first data set is coming from a survey of 1308 people, where participants were ask to report their race and how many homicide victims they knew. The question of interest is: “Does race predicts how many homicide victims a person knows?”. A set of count models were assessed (Poisson, Quasi-likelihood and Negative Binomial. The second analysis studies if there is an effect of the Graduate Record Exam scores (GRE), the grade point average (GPA), and the prestige of the undergraduate institution on the admission of an applicant into graduate school. The data set contains information about 400 graduate applicants as well as the status of their graduate school application (admitted or not admitted). A generalized linear model for binary data was used. Different link function were evaluated (Logit, Probit Log-log, Complementary Log-log).
